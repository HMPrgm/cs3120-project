# Software Engineering Textbook Library Project
Our project is a web application used for textbook lending, designed to help university bookstores. It includes features like A system for adding and removing textbooks, creating classes and collections for each book, and the ability to request, lend, and borrow textbooks. My role in the project was DevOps Manager.
